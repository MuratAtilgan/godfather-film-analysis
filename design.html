The dark red looks dramatic and             matches the violent themes in the movies. Gold represents wealth and power             which is important in the story.</p>            <p>For backgrounds I used light gray (#f4f4f4) and white. The gray makes             the page look cleaner than pure white. For the header and footer I used              dark backgrounds with white text to make them stand out.</p>            <p>For text colors I used dark gray (#333333) for the main body text because             it's easier to read than pure black. The headings are in dark red (#8B0000)             to match the theme. Navigation links are in very dark gray (#1a1a1a) so they're             easy to read against the light gray background. I made sure all text has good             contrast with its background for readability.</p>            <h3>Fonts</h3>            <p>For headings I used Georgia font because it's a serif font that looks             classic and elegant like the time period of the films. For the main text             I used Segoe UI which is a sans-serif font that's clean and easy to read.             This combination looks professional but still modern.</p>            <h3>Layout</h3>            <p>I used a simple layout with a header at the top, navigation menu below             that, then the main content, and a footer at the bottom. This structure             is similar to what we learned in Lab 4. The navigation menu uses a             horizontal layout with the links side by side, which I learned from the             lab examples.</p>                                    <h3>Navigation</h3>            <p>My navigation menu stays at the top and has links to all the main             pages. When you hover over the links they change to dark red background             with white text so you know they're clickable. The navigation has a             light gray background (#e8e8e8) to separate it from the rest of the page.</p>            <h3>Images</h3>            <p>I will use images from The Godfather films to make the site look             better. All images will have alt text so people using screen readers             can understand what the images show. The images will be sized properly             using CSS so they don't break the layout.</p>            <h3>Overall Design Style</h3>            <p>I wanted the website to look professional and match the serious tone             of The Godfather films. The dark red and gold colors give it an elegant             feel. The layout is clean and organized so visitors can easily find             information about the films. I tried to keep it simple and not too             complicated so it's easy to use.</p>        </article>    </main>        <footer>            <p>&copy; 2025 The Godfather Film Analysis | Created by Murat Atilgan - Web Development - UWS Student Project</p>			<p>Images used for educational analysis purposes under fair use guidelines.</p>        </footer>	</div>	</body></html>
